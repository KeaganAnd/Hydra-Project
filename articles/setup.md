## Getting Setup

#### Downloading Roblox Studio

To get kicked off, we need to get you in Roblox Studio. This is where all your games are made, you can do everything from scripting (Which we will focus on), UI, modeling, and even animating.

You can download it [here](https://create.roblox.com/)

Congrats! You've taken your first step into Roblox Development.

Now it's time to kick off.

This is your home page! If you notice the red arrows in the image i'll explain from top down.

1. **"New Experience"** allows you to make a new game, this is what we'll be using shortly.
2. **"My Recent Experiences"** are games you have recently edited, this should be blank for you.
3. **"Open a Template"** allows you to make a game with some pre placed scripts and models.
4. **"Discover Studio"** provides some simple tutorials like this one! Feel free to mess around with this and the last ones!

#### Making Your First Game
*Let's get started!*

First click the button on the top left that says **"New Experience"**

You should now be greeted with a blank workspace. Click the **"View"** button on the top of the screen.

Make sure that you have these three windows selected:
1. **Explorer**
2. **Properties**
3. **Output**

These will be the most used menus for developing.

##### Explorer
The explorer shows everything you have included in your game, like models, parts, or scripts. You can notice this menu on the right of your screen. Feel free to open folders. **"Workspace"** will hold everything you can see in the front of you.

##### Properties
The things you put into your games have properties. For example a block will have properties like color and size that you can change manually *or* as you'll learn with your scripts. Try selecting the baseplate from your explorer and mess with some of its properties.

##### Output
This is where errors in your script or print lines will show up! So if a script isn't working try looking at the output and research the error it gives you!

##### Navigating Studio
You can move around the Studio almost like it's a game itself!

- **WASD**: You can move left and right by pressing *'A'* and *'D'* or using the left and right arrow keys. You can also move forward and backward with *'W'* and *'S'* or using the up and down arrow keys.
- **Camera Movement**: Unlike most games you can't move your mouse to move your camera! Because most of the type you're clicking menus. You can hold right click and move your mouse to look around.
- **Advanced**: Once you get used to the previous two controls, you can also move around quicker by using the scroll wheel to move forward and backward quickly. You can also hold in the scroll wheel if your mouse supports it to pan around the game. And if you need to make more precise movements you can hold shift while pressing WASD to slow down.


#### Making A Part

Let's put your first part into your game!

1. Click the **Model** tab on the top of the screen to open your model tools.
